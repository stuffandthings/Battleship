# Battleship
2-player Battleship board game in Python I wrote my freshman year of college.

To run, simply run battleship.py with 'python battleship.py' in the command line, or open battleship.py in IDLE and press F5 to run.

The implementation is riddled with bugs, like off-by-one errors and incorrect placement issues. There is also no limit to the number of pegs a user can place. The game was made in a time crunch as my semester project for an introductory programming class, I never got around to fixing it.
